        gm ser or serina, so you want to make me like all casts on your behalf

        Fear not, in a few simple clicks (or taps, lmao) you will gain the
        buttons "activate" and "STOP". Use these and suddenly you don't have to
        do anything else â€” sit back, touch grass, relax, I will like all casts
        on your behalf.

      <p>First, log in below ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡</p>
